## Tugasan Utama

### Tugasan I: Seruan Perwira

Go to youtube link and download file from description.

Open the .eml file. Copy the base64 strings and save output to .zip. Itâ€™s password protected, the password is 3108. You can get the password by decoding the morse cipher in eml file. The .zip file contains image and .txt file. Open flag.txt and get flag.

### Tugasan II: Tali Barut

From previous chall, we can see the names of loki group member. Search on tiktok for p3tualang. Theres a vid with discord link, join the server.

Find message by user 0xm4mbang. Combine the one with 31 and 08, decode with bacon cipher.

Readd the numbers to get the flag. 3108{S3NT14SA\_P3KA}.

&#x20;

### Tugasan III: Pangkalan Gelap

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

One of the messages on discord is a c file, cant compile it due to error.

Asks chatgpt to fix and recompile.

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

Rot the output to get link to tryhackme room.

Start the box, its has 2 open port, 22 and 80(orry forgot to ss nmap). It seems like thereâ€™s nothing on the site.

Proceed to fuzz using big wordlist [https://github.com/six2dez/OneListForAll/blob/main/onelistforallmicro.txt](https://github.com/six2dez/OneListForAll/blob/main/onelistforallmicro.txt) (only using this cause hint said to fuzz, I donâ€™t recommend using it on real pentest). We finally found note.txt after fuzzing. Add itsloki.thm to /etc/hosts file.

Site seems using to be using textpattern CMS from the footer.

&#x20;

Googling for textpattern exploit led us to a post auth rce:[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51176](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51176)

So we need to figure out the creds first. From the hint, it seems we need to find creds on the site. Proceed to click all the links and view response on burp, finally find it at [http://itsloki.thm/index.php?rss=1](http://itsloki.thm/index.php?rss=1).

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

We can see the author is rok14h from site so use that at user and rok14h@l33t as password.

Now we can use the exploit we found previously. Just go to files option and upload our reverse shell, donâ€™t forget to setup a listener.

We can find the uploaded file at [http://itsloki.thm/files/oi.php](http://itsloki.thm/files/oi.php), execute the file to get shell. After getting shell I proceed to upgrade the shell to a more stable one using:

_python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'_

&#x20;

Then to search for flag I used find / -type f -name "\*.txt" -exec grep -l "3108" {} +

Found it at /usr/share/menu/Flag\_3.txt.

&#x20;

## Web

### Lemah

Go to site, one of js file loaded is auth.js. can see array of char codes. Run in console to convert to string.

### Wantujus

Go to site, we can see js script showing winCount need to be = 10 to get flag.

&#x20;

Change winCount value in console. We will get cookie.

Decode cookie from base64.

### Wantusom

Not sure whatâ€™s the difference with the last chall but I just change winCount value in console again, get cookie and decode from base64.

\


&#x20;

### Pantun Pantul

Google pantun, Tegak rumah kerana sendi, Runtuh sendi rumah binasa, Tegak bangsa kerana budi, Runtuh budi hilanglah bangsa. Complete the form with pantun.

At first the pantun doesnâ€™t appear but the clue says bendera() doesnâ€™t appear. After calling the function in console we finally got it.

### Warganegara

Going to the site, we cant see any response.

Using curl we get response that only warganegara is allowed.

From [https://webtechsurvey.com/response-header/x-country-code](https://webtechsurvey.com/response-header/x-country-code) , we figure out to use X-Country-Code: MY as header and get flag.

### Bendera

Based on description, it mentions banding which is compare. Iâ€™ve answered several challenges in the past which require us to exploit strcmp. Based on [php docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strcmp.php#108563), strcmp returns 0 in some cases where the variables being compared are of different types, for example a string and an array will return 0. So to bypass this check without knowing the `bendera` value we can simply set the bendera as an array.

## Reverse Engineering

### Sarawak

strings to get flag.

&#x20;

\


&#x20;

### Pa+rio+ik

Decompile in ida, press f5 to get pseudocode. We can see it is using encrypt function.

Decompile encrypt function.

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

To summarise the function:

Â·        v7=v8-1, this does rot on input.

Â·        there is an array in v5 which seems to be our flag in hex.

Â·        ^ 0x31 does xor.

Copy the hex value and use cyberchef to decode + xor by 31.

Donâ€™t forget to rot! Then we will get flag 3108{B4NG5A\_M3RD3K4}

### k0rban

Open in ida, decompile main function.

&#x20;

&#x20;

Decompile encrypt function(sub\_11E9)

Right click on -559038737 change to hexadecimal and we get 0xDEADBEEF

Ask chatgpt to create a script to decrypt and get flag ðŸ˜Š.

&#x20;

## Stega

### Tugu Negara

Just strings

&#x20;

&#x20;

### Jalur Gemilang

When we open the image it seems corrupted.

Open image with HxD to see the header.

Google the header to search for file with same header to compare.

From image from [https://www.yalehome.com/be/fr/content-fragments/news/2023/introducing-the-new-yale-home-app/yale-access-yale-home-16-9jpg](https://www.yalehome.com/be/fr/content-fragments/news/2023/introducing-the-new-yale-home-app/yale-access-yale-home-16-9jpg). Open it in HxD , we can see that the original image is missing FF D8 FF E2 0C at the start.. Add it to the image and reopen it.

Got the flag.

### Bangsal 1

Use steghide to extract, first extract with no password. Second extract with password kemerdekaan.

### Hari Keramat

Increase brightness and tinker with the image by editing till we can see angKaRahs1a.

&#x20;

Steghide the image with the password and we will get langitbumi.txt.

&#x20;

Use rot47 and get flag.

### Uncover

We can see the image have blocks of colours at the bottom. I tried to crop and reverse search the image but didnâ€™t find anything.

&#x20;

Tried to search for cipher color and found hexahue ciper.

Decode and get flag.

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

### Bangsal 2

From all the text in Kosmo3008.txt we can see the phrase katalaluan: anakmuda.

Steghide extract with anakmuda as password and get flag.

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

## Cryptography

### Nasihat

Just run the script with flag.txt.enc.

### Selamat Malam

Use dcode cipher identifier to find the possible cipher.

Use atbash decoder to decode.

By combining numbers and uppercase output, we get flag .3108{MALAYSIAAMAN}

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

### Keretapi Tanah Melayu ðŸš‚

&#x20;

&#x20;

### Jerebu

Open image and it seems like song notes.

Search for music cipher and found out it is solfa cipher. Find the parts with the number and decode it from there.

Flag is 3108{P3RJ4NJNASEAN}.

&#x20;

### 1957bit

&#x20;

### Perpaduan

Open site, we can see app.mediafire.com and a string. Combine and visit the combined url.

Download the .txt cnd cap file. Since it is a handshake file we can guess that we have to crack it using the give 3108.txt as wordlist. I used aircrack-ng to crack it and get flag.

&#x20;

## MISC

### Mencari Rahsia Si Dia

Use spammimic to decode it.

3108{sebuah\_erti\_pengorbanan}

### Pesan Tentang Bicara
